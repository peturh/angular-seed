# Intro to Web development

This is thought as a "seed" for your first Angular project.

It depends on 

* Nodejs
* NPM - Node Package Manager
* Most probably MongoDB also

## Information

This project is a Single Page Application that uses AngularJS as it's framework. It uses less for 
css preprocessing. And presumably bootstrap as css framework.

Things to read upon:

* angular api
* less 
* bootstrap

## Develop

Make sure you have installed Nodejs from their homepage. 

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm install -g webpack` to install the bundler, may be administrator to do this (sudo on linux and mac)
* Run `nodejs webpack-server.js` to run the development server, this refreshes your css and JS to a runnable website fast.

## Production

We'll get there...

Basically run `webpack` and it will create a folder called `dist/`
